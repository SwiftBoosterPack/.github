# SwiftBoosterPack

This is SwiftBoosterPack is a collection of boosters intended to make Swift development easier for the day-to-day developer.

It aims to reduce complicated or repetitive tasks to allow developers to focus on writing code for features instead of the rest of the overhead.

This won't eliminate every edge case, but it will hopefully make developing a little easier!

# [ConcurrencyBooster](https://github.com/SwiftBoosterPack/ConcurrencyBooster)

Aims to reduce some of the annoyances with concurrency, particularly around using locks and atomic/synchronization

# [CombinePublisherBooster](https://github.com/SwiftBoosterPack/CombinePublisherBooster)

Looks to provide publishers for Combine that are similar to those provided by RxSwift

# [CombineTestingBooster](https://github.com/SwiftBoosterPack/CombineTestingBooster)

Provide content to make testing custom Combine implementations more easily.

# Contributing

If you want to contribute, create an issue or reach out! We aim to create boosters that are targeted to very specific repetetive issues.
